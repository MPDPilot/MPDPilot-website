MPD Pilot can connect not only to MPD servers but also to popular solutions based on MPD, including [Mopidy](https://mopidy.com) (with [MPD extension](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-mpd)), [Volumio](https://volumio.org), [MoOde Audio](https://moodeaudio.org), [Bryston](https://bryston.com), and [Chord Poly](https://chordelectronics.co.uk/product/poly). This compatibility makes it versatile for use with a range of MPD-based audio systems.

If you’re running multiple servers, MPD Pilot lets you switch between them without hassle. This simple setup process makes it easy for you to enjoy your music library without the fuss of manual configuration.
